Here are some helpful websites to get thinking about ddRADSeq data analysis.

# Stacks: This will be ran first on the raw data to trim adapters, filter the data, and to call SNPs. (STACKS is already loaded on Suzy's Server FUNK and CURIE). 
https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/manual/

We will use STACKS to run process_radtags and denovo_map.pl. See if you can figure out what these commands are doing and how to run them/what do each of the parameters mean. populations is another
STACKS command we can use to help optimize the data and will want to do this multiple times for the paper.
